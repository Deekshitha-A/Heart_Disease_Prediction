# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease) includes numerous problems,many of which are related to a process called atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.
