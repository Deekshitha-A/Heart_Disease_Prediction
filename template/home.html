 	<p class="c3"><b>Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease) includes numerous problems,
        many of which are related to a process called atherosclerosis.

     Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque
        builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can
        block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.</b></p>
